					<h4 class="row-align">Why does The Rooster crow everyday before sunrise?</h4><br>
					<p>The Rooster’s Tale is a highly interactive Solo piece written and performed by Hariharan Ganapathy
					(aka) Kavin Jay Babu. The play tries to answer the question 'Why does The Rooster crow everyday before sunrise?' and many more as it takes the audience on a magical journey through the great forest of Kaaad-o- Kaaadu. As the story unravels we encounter a flurry of characters like the thoughtful Rooster, a power hungry dog, an angry Madam Sun
					and many more…</p>
					<p>Inspired from several folk tales and origin stories from across cultures, “The Rooster’s Tale”also
					performed in Tamil as “Sevalin Kathai”uses Tamil folk dances, , singing and storytelling to create a
					narrative to engage children and adults alike.</p>

        			<div class="row row-align">
        				<div class="col-sm-6">
        					<p> Keeping the interactive design in mind, the play begins
							with games to draw one into the story and the format continues throughout. In a playful manner it
							also tries to address some very pertinent issues that one faces in today’s world.
							By keeping the performance Bilingual by choice, in a mixture of Tamil and English, the play tries to
							reach as wide an audience as possible. This flexibility allows the performance to be wholly done in
							English/Tamil or a mix of both depending on the composition of the audience or preference of the
							hosts.</p>
							<p>An attempt has been done with this play to take it to alternate performance spaces ranging from
							people’s living rooms, terraces, Dance Studios, Rehearsal spaces and Office Conference rooms ,
							well…just about anywhere!</p>
						</div>
        				<div class="col-sm-6">	
							<p>The idea being to break away from having to travel to a theatre instead taking the play to the one’s
							own door steps. Thus bringing in newer audience and effectively creating more spaces of engagement
							closer home. In this journey the solo has been performed at Dancer Anita Rathnam’s rehearsal space,
							Dancer Meera krishnan Terrace where she hosts Art on the Terrace, and at rehearsal spaces of many
							prominent local theatre groups including Tamilnadu’s only full time theatre group Koothu-p-Pattarai
							where the 24 & 25 shows were perormed. The play has been performed 33 times as of now and
							counting.</p>
